- Use vector field instead of flow
- Minimize notation
- Call x0 point of interest. Maybe use x0 and x1 instead of x0 and x
- Avoid dot for matrix product
- Clarify what norm is
- Mention other approaches to quasipotential theory in the intro
- Curl-free potential? / field?
- Several trajectories from a saddle node to a stable equilibrium cannot be simultaneously continous at both points
  - Taking averages or other tricks? See Jelle's paper.

## About Zhou's paper

- Their methods require both simplicity enough to be applicable and mathematical expertise
- They don't seem to output an associated error
- Give them credit enough
