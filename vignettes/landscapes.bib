Basins of attraction, in the sense of wells in a surface, are used to measure, for instance, resilience. But they those surfaces don't exist in general.

abstract = {Nongradient stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with position-dependent and anisotropic diffusion are often used in biological modeling. The quasi-potential is a crucial function in the Large Deviation Theory that allows one to estimate transition rates between attractors of the corresponding ordinary differential equation and find the maximum likelihood transition paths. Unfortunately, the quasi-potential can rarely be found analytically. It is defined as the solution to a certain action minimization problem. In this work, the recently introduced Ordered Line Integral Method (OLIM) is extended for computing the quasi-potential for 2D SDEs with anisotropic and position-dependent diffusion scaled by a small parameter on a regular rectangular mesh. The presented solver employs the dynamical programming principle. At each step, a local action minimization problem is solved using straight line path segments and the midpoint quadrature rule. The solver is tested on two examples where analytic formulas for the quasi-potential are available. The dependence of the computational error on the mesh size, the update factor K (a key parameter of OLIMs), as well as the degree and the orientation of anisotropy is established. The effect of anisotropy on the quasi-potential and the maximum likelihood paths is demonstrated on the Maier–Stein model. The proposed solver is applied to find the quasi-potential and the maximum likelihood transition paths in a model of the genetic switch in Lambda Phage between the lysogenic state where the phage reproduces inside the infected cell without killing it, and the lytic state where the phage destroys the infected cell.},

One of QPot's key features is the computation of the quasi-potential, an important tool for studying stochastic systems. Quasi-potentials are particularly useful for comparing the relative stabilities of equilibria in systems with alternative stable states. This paper describes QPot's primary functions, and explains how quasi-potentials can yield insights about the dynamics of stochastic systems.

abstract = {The developmental dynamics of multicellular organisms is a process that takes place in a multi-stable system in which each attractor state represents a cell type, and attractor transitions cor-respond to cell differentiation paths. This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the 'relative stabilities' of N attractors (N . 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin–Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.},

@article{Bhattacharya2011,
abstract = {Background: The image of the " epigenetic landscape " , with a series of branching valleys and ridges depicting stable cellular states and the barriers between those states, has been a popular visual metaphor for cell lineage specification -especially in light of the recent discovery that terminally differentiated adult cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells or into alternative cell lineages. However the question of whether the epigenetic landscape can be mapped out quantitatively to provide a predictive model of cellular differentiation remains largely unanswered. Results: Here we derive a simple deterministic path-integral quasi-potential, based on the kinetic parameters of a gene network regulating cell fate, and show that this quantity is minimized along a temporal trajectory in the state space of the gene network, thus providing a marker of directionality for cell differentiation processes. We then use the derived quasi-potential as a measure of " elevation " to quantitatively map the epigenetic landscape, on which trajectories flow " downhill " from any location. Stochastic simulations confirm that the elevation of this computed landscape correlates to the likelihood of occurrence of particular cell fates, with well-populated low-lying " valleys " representing stable cellular states and higher " ridges " acting as barriers to transitions between the stable states. Conclusions: This quantitative map of the epigenetic landscape underlying cell fate choice provides mechanistic insights into the " forces " that direct cellular differentiation in the context of physiological development, as well as during artificially induced cell lineage reprogramming. Our generalized approach to mapping the landscape is applicable to non-gradient gene regulatory systems for which an analytical potential function cannot be derived, and also to high-dimensional gene networks. Rigorous quantification of the gene regulatory circuits that govern cell lineage choice and subsequent mapping of the epigenetic landscape can potentially help identify optimal routes of cell fate reprogramming.
